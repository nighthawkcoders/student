```Java
public class StepTracker {
    private int minSteps;
    private int totalSteps;
    private int activeDays;
    private int totalDays;

    public StepTracker(int minSteps) {
        this.minSteps = minSteps;
        this.totalSteps = 0;
        this.activeDays = 0;
        this.totalDays = 0;
    }

    public void addDailySteps(int steps) {
        totalSteps += steps;
        totalDays++;
        if (steps >= minSteps) {
            activeDays++;
        }
    }

    public int activeDays() {
        return activeDays;
    }

    public double averageSteps() {
        if (totalDays == 0) {
            return 0.0;
        } else {
            return (double) totalSteps / totalDays;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a StepTracker object with a minimum step requirement of 10,000
        StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);

        // Add daily steps and test the methods
        tr.addDailySteps(9000);
        tr.addDailySteps(5000);
        System.out.println("Active Days: " + tr.activeDays()); // Should print 0
        System.out.println("Average Steps: " + tr.averageSteps()); // Should print 0.0

        tr.addDailySteps(13000);
        System.out.println("Active Days: " + tr.activeDays()); // Should print 1
        System.out.println("Average Steps: " + tr.averageSteps()); // Should print 9000.0

        tr.addDailySteps(23000);
        tr.addDailySteps(1111);
        System.out.println("Active Days: " + tr.activeDays()); // Should print 2
        System.out.println("Average Steps: " + tr.averageSteps()); // Should print 10222.2
    }
}

StepTracker.main(null);
```

    Active Days: 0
    Average Steps: 7000.0
    Active Days: 1
    Average Steps: 9000.0
    Active Days: 2
    Average Steps: 10222.2


### StepTracker Class Definition


```Java
public class StepTracker {
}
```

- It has instance variables and methods to track and calculate step-related information

### Instance Variables


```Java
private int minSteps;
private int totalSteps;
private int activeDays;
private int totalDays;
```

- minSteps: This variable holds the minimum number of steps required for a day to be considered active
- totalSteps: This variable accumulates the total number of steps taken across all days
- activeDays: It counts the number of days where the step count exceeded or equaled minSteps
- totalDays: This variable keeps track of the total number of days for which step data has been recorded

### Constructor


```Java
public StepTracker(int minSteps) {
    this.minSteps = minSteps;
    this.totalSteps = 0;
    this.activeDays = 0;
    this.totalDays = 0;
}
```

- The constructor initializes the minSteps instance variable with the provided minSteps parameter
- It sets totalSteps, activeDays, and totalDays to zero, as there is no data recorded initially

### addDailySteps Method


```Java
public int activeDays() {
    return activeDays;
}
```

- addDailySteps is used to accumulate daily step counts
- It increments totalSteps by the number of steps taken on the current day
- totalDays is incremented to keep track of the total number of days
- If the number of steps on the current day is greater than or equal to minSteps, it increments activeDays

### averageSteps Method


```Java
public double averageSteps() {
    if (totalDays == 0) {
        return 0.0;
    } else {
        return (double) totalSteps / totalDays;
    }
}
```

- averageSteps method calculates and returns the average number of steps per day
- It handles the case where no data has been recorded yet by returning 0.0 to prevent division by zero

### Main Method for Testing


```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a StepTracker object with a minimum step requirement of 10,000
    StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);

    // Add daily steps and test the methods
    // ...

}
```

- The main method is used for testing the StepTracker class
- It creates a StepTracker object tr with a minimum step requirement of 10,000, adds daily steps, and tests the activeDays and averageSteps methods
