This kernel provides a shell, or <mark>terminal</mark>, that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands.  Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell/terminal as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process.  To activate a shell directly, users will run a \"terminal\" through the Desktop. <mark>VS Code provides ability to activate \"terminal\"</mark> while in the IDE."

      "- The purpose is to build lessons and distribute across different Computer Science sections (CSSE, CSP, CSA), a pathway that covers 3 years of High School Instruction.\n",
      "- The primary languages and frameworks that are taught are `JavaScript/HTML/CSS`, `Python/Flask`, `Java/Spring`.  Read below for more details.\n",
      "- In this course, Teacher content is not exclusively developed by Teachers.  In fact, many Students have been invited to develop and publish content into this repository.  Their names will appear as authors on the content which they aided in producing.\n",
