## **How to write code**
Learning to code requires four core ideas.
1. <mark> Variables</mark>  
-These are specifc values to write code.
2. <mark> Loops</mark>  
-These are codes for repetition.
3. <mark> Conditionals</mark>  
-These are if/then statements used to specify options available in a situation.
4. <mark> Functions</mark>  
-These are words, numbers, or special characters in a particular combination which tells the computer how to perform a task.

## Coding is done using computer languages such as Python, Javascript, Swift, Ruby, C#, etc.
For example, Python writes variables in quotation marks such as: "1 2 3 4 5 6" or "Michael Jackson".

It also has functions such as \n (new line), \t (tab), and del (delete a variable)

Python has if/else statements such as

If(:"Selected variable =1") print ("2") 
else print ("3")
