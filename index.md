This is my schedule for this trimester:

| Period   | Class   |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1        | AP Calc    |
| 2        | AP World     |
| 3        | Honors Humanities    |
| 4        | AP Physics    |
| 5        | AP CSP     |

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
